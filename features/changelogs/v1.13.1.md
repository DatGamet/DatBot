# 📙 v1.13.1

### Highlights

* Level Updates
* Bug Fixes

### New commands

* `/level roles debug` ([#commands](../our-features/level.md#commands "mention"))
* `/level roles sync` ([#commands](../our-features/level.md#commands "mention"))

### Updates

* `/level roles remove`: You do not need to enter the level anymore. Just provide the role. ^^
* Level Roles: You will now get the role if you do not have it yet and got a level which matches **OR IS HIGHER** than the required level (before: you had to have the exact level)
* The level commands have been rewritten to gain a better performance

### Deleted command

* `/level roles toggle` because it has not been used (very much)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a problem where level roles have not been added
