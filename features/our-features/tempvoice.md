* This error appears if you have been banned from the system by a server moderator.&#x20;
* This ban is not global.

### Functions

* Moderation
  * Blocking users: You can block users. They cannot create and manage temporary voice channels while they are blocked.
  * Logging: It works in principle like the Discord Audit Log, but is for temporary voice channels. All actions, for example renaming the channel, are logged.
  * Moderation Role: By default, you must have the permission Administrator to be able to manage the system. People who have this role can manage the temporary voice channels, but not the system settings themselves. See also: [#permissions](tempvoice.md#permissions "mention")
* Channel customization
  * You can manage the temporary voice channel with the interface.
  * You can manage privacy, users and the channel.

### Set-Up

1. Use /tempvoice setup and click in the "Continue" button.
2.  Select the type.

    Quick: If you choose this option,  the bot creates a category, a text channel, in which it sends the interface and creates a voice channel, which is functioning as the creator channel.

    Manual: Set the creator channel and send the interface manually
