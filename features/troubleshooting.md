### Permissions

A lot of trouble is caused by missing permissions. Dat Bot has many queries of its own permissions, but sometimes this is not feasible. As an example you could take the LevelUp message. If the bot has no permissions to send messages in the channel, it cannot inform anyone that it is not working. So if errors occur, it may be due to missing authorizations. Basically, the bot needs “Send Messages”, “Embed Links” and “View Channel”.

### "The application did not respond"

In this case, it is very likely that the bot is completely <mark style="color:red;">offline</mark>. It is often displayed as <mark style="color:green;">online</mark>, but is in the rate limit. If this happens, please always contact [support](https://discord.com/invite/BQumAujuvk).

### "❌ ・An error has occurred."

In this case, an error has occurred that has been detected but not identified. Try to use the command/button/... again. If the error persists, contact [Support](https://discord.com/invite/BQumAujuvk).
